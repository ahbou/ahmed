A commit based introduction.
-------


I'm Ahmed and I'm 23 years old.
I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I like to write code in C or C++ but I'm also learning Javascript and PHP on the side.

I work at LVMH in the Digital team. 
We're working on the very first iPad apps for Store managers.
I'm using Objective-C at work.

I was telling a guy in a Caf√© about my job and he told me about his app idea.
So now I'm making the very first Sidur for iPhone as a freelancer! (it's a jewish prayers book).

--- 

I use a 13" Mackbook pro with 4GB of RAM.

And I just bought an iPhone 4. It's the most beautiful smartphone I've seen!
