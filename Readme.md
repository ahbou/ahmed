A commit based introduction.
-------

I'm Ahmed and I'm 30 years old.
I'm an iOS engineer based in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦 with my Wife 💑 and our 1 year old son 👶🏻

**I'm smoke free for a year now!**

I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I spend most of my day in Xcode and I'm advocating for a world of Swift everywhere.
I also enjoy using Ruby and Kotlin.

I'm leading the development of a fully digital way to buy car insurance in Morocco and Africa at Wafa Assurance.
The corporate world is `weird`

* I use a powered up Retina 13" Mackbook pro.
* I have an iPhone X.
* I have a Series 0 Apple Watch.
* I have an iPad mini.
* I use an Apple TV.

My wife and I went sky diving in the South of Morocco.
It was as thrilling as dropping a database in production 😁
