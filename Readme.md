A commit based introduction.
-------

I'm Ahmed and I'm 30 years old.
I'm an iOS engineer based in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦 with my Wife 💑 and our 1 year old son 👶🏻

**I'm smoke free for a year now!**

I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I spend most of my day in Xcode and I'm advocating for a world of Swift everywhere.
I also enjoy using Ruby and Kotlin.

I'm the technical lead at Gojugo. We are building a new way for contractors to find clients and vice versa.
Our iOS app is 100% Swift too.

We just shipped a map view using RXSwift and Websockets, the future is awesome!

I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem™:
* I use a Retina 13" Mackbook pro.
* I have an iPhone 7.
* I just got an iPad mini.

My wife and I went sky diving in the South of Morocco.
It was as thrilling as dropping a database in production 😁
