A commit based introduction.

I'm Ahmed and I'm 24 years old.
I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I like to write code in C or C++ but I'm also learning Javascript and PHP on the side.

I work at LVMH in the Digital team.
Using Objective-C we just released MyStore: An iPad app for Store managers.

I was telling a guy in a Caf√© about my job and he told me about his app idea. it's Sidur for iPhone! (a jewish prayers book).

And today we shipped V1.0.

I use a 13" Mackbook pro with 4GB of RAM.

And I just bought an iPhone 4. It's the most beautiful smartphone I've seen!
