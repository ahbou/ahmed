A commit based introduction.

I'm Ahmed and I'm 32 years old.
I'm an iOS engineer based in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦 with my Wife 💑 and our 3 years old son 👶🏻

**I'm smoke free for 4 years now!**

I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I spend most of my day in Xcode and I'm advocating for a world of Swift everywhere (We call it Swift world domination)
I also enjoy using Ruby and Kotlin.

I just finished a SwiftUI training in Italy 🇮🇹.

I'm reading a book per month so at least 12 per year.

I also go jogging at leat once per week.

My wife and I went sky diving in the South of Morocco.
It was as thrilling as dropping a database in production 😁
