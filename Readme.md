A commit based introduction.

I'm Ahmed and I'm 9 years old now!
I just got a PlayStation and it's **AWESOME!!** 
The games feel so real and detailed! Also you can move in all directions now.

I managed to install Mario on the computer too! So I don't really use the Nintendo now.
The computer has Windows 95 and I spend so much time tweaking the Control Panel, it's awesome too!

I found a `Disassembler` program and when I open the Mario game with it, I'm able to see the code and the images!
It's both weird and intriguing 🤩

I managed to change the image of Mario by a very pixelated image, but it so fun to play with 👾
