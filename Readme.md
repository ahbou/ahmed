A commit based introduction.
-------

I'm Ahmed and I'm 29 years old.
I'm an iOS engineer based in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦 with my Wife 💑 and our 1 year old son 👶🏻

** I'm smoke free for a year now! **

I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I just joined Gojugo as the technical lead.
With the CTO, we are building a new way for contractors to find clients and vice versa.
Our iOS app is 100% Swift too.

I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem™:
* I use a Retina 13" Mackbook pro.
* I have an iPhone 6.
* I just got an iPad mini.
