I'm Ahmed and I'm 9 years old now!
I just got a PlayStation and it's **AWESOME!!** 
The games feel so real and detailed! Also you can move in all directions now.

I broke the PC, it won't boot ðŸ˜”

I don't have a computer now so I'm starting to play more and more games.

Also I started learning Spanish at school.
