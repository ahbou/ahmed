A commit based introduction.

I'm Ahmed and I'm 24 years old.
I'm living in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦
I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I like to write code in Objecive-C and I avoid using Java.
I'm also decent at using Javascript/Jquery with PHP.

I'm working as a freelancer for My Bazar, the French private sales site, making their iOS app.

On my free time, I launched an iOS app for Morocco to find restaurant Menus.

I use a 13" Mackbook pro with 4GB of RAM.

And I just bought an iPhone 4. It's the most beautiful smartphone I've seen!
