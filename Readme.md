A commit based introduction.
-------

I'm Ahmed and I'm 29 years old.
I'm an iOS engineer based in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦 with my Wife 💑 and our 1 year old son 👶🏻

** I'm smoke free for a year now! **

I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I mostly use Objective-C and Xcode but I'm getting deeper in using Swift.

I'm currently the iOS Lead at Prism.io where we're making screenshots suck less.

Our screenshot editor just made it to the #1 spot on ProductHunt.

I just made the top 200 indie developers macrumors list!

Today I'm taking a Swift training in Verona, Italy 🇮🇹

I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem™:
* I use a Retina 13" Mackbook pro.
* I have an iPhone 6.
* I just got an iPad mini.
