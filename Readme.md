A commit based introduction.
-------


I'm Ahmed and I'm 28 years old.
I'm an iOS engineer based in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦 with my Wife 💑 and we just had a baby boy 👶🏻

** I'm smoke free for 4 months now! **

I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I mostly use Objective-C and Xcode but I'm starting to experiment with the new and shiny Swift.

I'm currently the iOS Lead at Prism.io where we're making screenshots suck less.

Our screenshot editor just made it to the #1 spot on ProductHunt.

I just made the top 200 indie developers macrumors list!

I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem™:
* I use a Retina 13" Mackbook pro.
* I have an iPhone 6.
* I just got an iPad mini.
