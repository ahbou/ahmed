A commit based introduction.

I'm Ahmed and I'm 24 years old.
I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I like to write code in Objecive-C and I avoid using Java.
I'm also decent at using Javascript/Jquery with PHP.

Today I got a really big freelance project offer from My Bazar: The French private sales site.

I decided to work on it full time.

I use a 13" Mackbook pro with 4GB of RAM.

And I just bought an iPhone 4. It's the most beautiful smartphone I've seen!
