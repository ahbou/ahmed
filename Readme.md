A commit based introduction.

I'm Ahmed and I'm 26 years old.
I'm an iOS engineer based in Casablanca, Morocco 🇲🇦 with my Wife 💑
I have a Master's degree in Information Technology.

I mostly use Objective-C and Xcode but I'm starting to experiment with the new and shiny Swift.
Bu I'm also decent at using Javascript/Jquery.
I'm trying to learn Ruby on Rails.


I mostly work as a consultant and I help my clients ship quality apps.

On my free time, I maintain Souwelni an iOS app for Morocco to find restaurant Menus.

I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem:
* I use a 13" Mackbook pro.
* I have an iPhone 5.
* I just got an iPad mini.
